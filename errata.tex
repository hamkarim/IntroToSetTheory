\begin{enumerate}

\item Page 62, Exercise 5.4. The hint should read ``Let $h(x) = A - x$; \ldots'' instead of ``Let $h(x) = B - x$; \ldots''.
  (Confirmed by Dr. Jech)

\item Page 101, Exercise 2.3. This is ambiguous and means that that the countable dense subset is dense in $P$ rather than simply dense with respect to itself. (Unconfirmed)

\item Page 114, Exercise 3.5 part (c). This should read ``\ldots, then $f[A] \in V_\w$.'' instead of ``\ldots, then $f[X] \in V_\w$.'' since $X$ has not been previously defined. (Unconfirmed)

\end{enumerate}
