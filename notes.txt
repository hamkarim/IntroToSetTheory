Unfinished or needs work:
2. Section about transfinite recursion (esp exercise 6.4.1)
3. Better way to provide references for lemmas, perhaps using custom counters
4. Color lemmas/theorems/etc. statements to make them easier to pick out but with coloring bounding rects
5. Note theorems from theorems doc suffixed with T

Incomplete or problematic exercises:
-First chapters
-Exercise 5.2.2 (Rudin)
-Exercise 5.2.7 (Tedious and Rudin)
