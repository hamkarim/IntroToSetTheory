\begin{lem}\label{lem:aleph:wolege}
  For well ordered sets $A$ and $B$ either $\aA \leq \aB$ or $\aB \leq \aA$ (or both in which case $\aA = \aB$).
\end{lem}
\qproof{
  By Theorem~6.1.3 we have:

  Case: $A$ and $B$ are isomorphic.
  Let $f$ be the isomorphism from $A$ to $B$.
  Then clearly $f$ is a bijection so that $\aA = \aB$.
  Also since $f$ is injective $\aA \leq \aB$.
  Clearly also $\inv{f}$ is bijective from $B$ to $A$ so that $\aB \leq \aA$ as well.

  Case: $A$ is isomorphic to an initial segment of $B$.
  Then if $f$ is the isomorphism clearly $f$ is an injective function from $A$ to $B$ so that $\aA \leq \aB$.

  Case: $B$ is isomorphic to an initial segment of $A$.
  Then if $f$ is the isomorphism clearly $f$ is an injective function from $B$ to $A$ so that $\aB \leq \aA$.

  Since these cases are exhaustive by Theorem~6.1.3 clearly the result has been shown.

  Note that this did not require the Axiom of Choice.
