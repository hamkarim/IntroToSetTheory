\begin{lem}\label{lem:aleph:initle}
  For initial ordinals $\a$ and $\b$, if $\abs{\a} \leq \abs{\b}$, then $\a \leq \b$.
\end{lem}
\qproof{
  Suppose that $\abs{\a} \leq \abs{\b}$ but that $\a > \b$.
  Then clearly $\b$ is isomorphic (and therefore equipotent) to an initial segment of $\a$ so that $\abs{\b} \leq \abs{\a}$.
  Then by the Cantor-Bernstein Theorem we have $\abs{\a} = \abs{\b}$.
  However since $\a$ is an initial ordinal and $\b < \a$ it cannot be that $\abs{\a} = \abs{\b}$.
  Thus we have a contradiction so that it must be that $\a \leq \b$ as desired.
