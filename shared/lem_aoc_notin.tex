\begin{lem}\label{lem:aoc:notin}
  For any set $A$, there is a $b \notin A$.
\end{lem}
\qproof{
  Let $X = \braces{\a \in A \where \a \text{ is an ordinal number}}$.
  Then by Theorem~6.2.6e there is an ordinal $\a$ such that $\a \notin X$.
  It also has to be that $\a \notin A$ since, if it were, then $\a$ would be in $X$ since it is an ordinal number, which would be a contradiction.
