\begin{lem}\label{lem:aleph:initlimit}
  Every infinite initial ordinal is a limit ordinal.
\end{lem}
\qproof{
  Suppose that $\a$ is an infinite initial ordinal and that it a successor so that $\a = \b+1$.
  It was shown in Lemma~\ref{lem:aleph:infwo:succ} that $\abs{\b} = \abs{\b+1} = \abs{\a}$, but since clearly $\b < \a$ this contradicts the fact that $\a$ is an initial ordinal.
  Hence $\a$ must be a limit ordinal.
